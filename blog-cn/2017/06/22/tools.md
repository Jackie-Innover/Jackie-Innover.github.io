  The *Process Explorer* display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that *Process Explorer* is in: if it is in handle mode you'll see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if *Process Explorer* is in DLL mode you'll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. *Process Explorer* also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLs loaded.
